# About Me
Hello! My name is Matthew, I'm 18 and I'm from Belfast, Northern Ireland.

I started way back on a Windows 98 Machine (pure shock, a kid born in 2005 with a windows 98 machine) and I have progressed through the horror-scape of new operating systems. I also have recent experience in using linux machines for both industrial and personal use.

I enjoy learning and if anyone has any feedback they are willing to leave, please leave a comment on anything. I am, of course, still learning.

I also hold an Amateur Radio Licence, MI7EHN, and hope to be able to afford and build embedded systems for my Amatuer Radio hobby.

who knows where the wind will take us?
